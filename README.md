Compiler Course

### Notes
* Passes are contained within *projects*, for a few weeks
* All projects take input -> x86_64
* Every pass is a method building on an *object*; for open recursion
* Language stays (mostly) surface level abstraction

* Look in utilities for System V
* Look in utilities for Debugging stuff (check-passes)

* Task: Look through S3 tests and think of more tests.
* Read: `functions.rkt` for help with `lambda.rkt`

Compiler Course

## To do:
* Implement anonymous functions: `lambda.rkt`
* Do: Look through S3 tests and think of more tests.
* Read: `functions.rkt` for help with `lambda.rkt`

Notes for work:

* Closure implementation is already handled for `define` bodies (*piggy back?*)
* What happens after type-checking? *Terms retain their types?*

## Course Notes (thus far):
* Passes are contained within *projects*, for a few weeks
* All projects take input -> x86_64
* Every pass is a method building on an *object*; for **open recursion**

## Useful files:
* Look in utilities for System V
* Look in utilities for Debugging stuff (`check-passes`)
